The Wine Quality Dataset involves predicting the quality of white wines on a scale given chemical measures of each wine.

It is a multi-class classification problem, but could also be framed as a regression problem. The number of observations for each class is not balanced. There are 4,898 observations with 11 input variables and one output variable. The variable names are as follows:

Fixed acidity.
Volatile acidity.
Citric acid.
Residual sugar.
Chlorides.
Free sulfur dioxide.
Total sulfur dioxide.
Density.
pH.
Sulphates.
Alcohol.
Quality (score between 0 and 10).
The baseline performance of predicting the mean value is an RMSE of approximately 0.148 quality points.
